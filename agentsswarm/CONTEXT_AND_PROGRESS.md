# AgentSwarm Context and Progress

This document captures the current context, architecture, operational expectations, recent hardening work, and remaining roadmap for `agentsswarm/`.

## Purpose

`agentsswarm/` is a compact bridge runtime for chat-first orchestration.

It sits between inbound chat connectors and the downstream AgentSwarm / Claw-Empire API and is optimized for:

- routing `$` directives and `#` tasks from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, and CLI
- applying compact-pack and provider-profile defaults at the bridge layer
- registering channel/project/task routes for reply and relay behavior
- relaying managed task status updates back to the originating connector
- giving operators a small CLI and HTTP surface for health, packs, providers, channels, summary, ingest, and maintenance

## Current Architecture

### Runtime modules

- `src/index.js`: HTTP bridge, ingress validation, route registration, dedupe, maintenance prune endpoint, request IDs, and persistence scheduling
- `src/config.js`: env loading, runtime defaults, safety settings, TTL settings, retry settings, and config issue surfacing
- `src/orchestrator.js`: execution context assembly, pack/profile resolution, and downstream metadata shaping
- `src/forwarder.js`: downstream API integration, auth bootstrap, project binding, compact-agent scoping, task create/run, task list, connector send, and retry-aware GET handling
- `src/providers.js`: provider profile catalog, CLI tool inventory, availability-aware profile selection, and provider summary
- `src/compact-packs.js`: compact pack definitions and override parsing
- `src/channels.js`: normalized route and connector payload contract
- `src/status-relay.js`: managed-task polling and relay updates
- `src/state-store.js`: persistent bridge state storage
- `src/cli.js`: operator commands (`health`, `routes`, `channels`, `summary`, `providers`, `packs`, `preflight`, `doctor`, `ingest`, `prune`)
- `src/logger.js`: structured runtime logging and request ID helpers

### Stored state

The bridge persists:

- channel routes
- project routes
- task routes
- managed task IDs
- last-known task statuses

Default state file: `agentsswarm/data/bridge-state.json`

## Execution Model

### `$` directives

- require a project path or default project path
- resolve an existing project by path or create one if missing
- forward to `/api/inbox` with compact-pack, provider profile, and workflow metadata

### `#` tasks

- create a task through `/api/tasks`
- optionally run immediately when `TASK_COMMAND_MODE=hybrid`
- only register on the board when `TASK_COMMAND_MODE=board_only`
- map the created task back to the source connector for relay updates

### Route precedence

1. task route
2. channel route
3. project route
4. configured default route

## Baseline Before This Pass

Before the current hardening pass, the runtime already had:

- a clear modular split
- compact pack and provider profile abstractions
- a small operator CLI and health surface
- unit coverage around routing, provider defaults, forwarder behavior, relay logic, and state storage

The main gaps were:

- weak `/ingest` validation and no request size cap
- unauthenticated bridge operation when `BRIDGE_SECRET` was empty
- synchronous non-atomic state writes
- no request correlation IDs or structured logs
- silent config fallback on invalid JSON overrides
- no route TTL pruning or maintenance endpoint
- no message-id dedupe for connector retries
- limited resilience around transient upstream GET failures
- no project-path lookup cache
- confusing `direct_run` mode semantics
- provider selection that did not prefer available tools automatically

## Progress Completed In This Pass

### 1. Security and ingress hardening

Completed:

- made `BRIDGE_SECRET` required by default unless `ALLOW_UNSECURED_BRIDGE=true`
- added bounded request-body reads with `MAX_INGEST_BODY_BYTES`
- added stronger ingest validation for command text, IDs, route fields, platform support, and absolute project paths
- added request IDs on responses and structured runtime logs for successful and rejected requests
- added `messageId` support for deduplicating repeated connector deliveries inside a TTL window

### 2. Reliability and state safety

Completed:

- replaced synchronous state writes with async best-effort atomic writes via temp-file + rename
- queued bridge-state persistence to avoid repeated blocking writes during rapid updates
- added TTL-based pruning for stale channel, project, and task routes
- added `POST /maintenance/prune` and `npm run cli -- prune` for operator cleanup
- added project-path lookup caching to avoid repeated paginated project searches
- added retry-aware GET requests for transient upstream failures

### 3. Provider and pack execution quality

Completed:

- added availability-aware provider selection so execution prefers runnable profiles when possible
- surfaced unavailable profile IDs in provider summaries and health tooling
- normalized deprecated `TASK_COMMAND_MODE=direct_run` to `hybrid` and exposed it as a config issue instead of pretending it is a distinct mode

### 4. Operator visibility

Completed:

- surfaced config issues in health, summary, providers, packs, preflight, and doctor output
- added structured logs for bridge start, ingest handling, task/directive forwarding, relay sends, retry events, and prune operations

### 5. Test coverage

Completed:

- added config tests for bridge-secret enforcement and config issue surfacing
- added provider fallback tests for unavailable tools
- added forwarder tests for project lookup cache reuse and transient GET retries
- added bridge tests for oversized requests, message-id dedupe, and prune maintenance behavior
- updated state-store tests for async writes

## Current Verification Status

Last verified in `agentsswarm/` with:

```bash
npm run check
npm test
```

Both passed after the changes in this pass.

## Runtime Safety Notes

### Authentication

- `BRIDGE_SECRET` should be set for every non-local deployment
- `ALLOW_UNSECURED_BRIDGE=true` is only intended for explicit local development
- `INBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` remains required for downstream inbox forwarding
- `SWARMCLAW_ACCESS_KEY` remains required for connector sends and doctor/preflight health

### Dedupe behavior

- inbound events may include `messageId`
- dedupe key is `commandType + normalized route key + messageId`
- dedupe is TTL-based and intended to absorb connector retries, not replace upstream idempotency guarantees

### State cleanup behavior

Default TTLs:

- channel routes: 7 days
- project routes: 7 days
- task routes: 3 days
- project-path lookup cache: 5 minutes
- message-id dedupe cache: 5 minutes

Operators can prune immediately with:

```bash
npm run cli -- prune
npm run cli -- prune --dry-run
```

## Remaining Roadmap

These are still worthwhile after the current pass:

### Near-term

- add optional pack-role validation so each compact pack can report missing or unavailable provider profiles directly
- add richer operator trace tooling such as `task trace <id>` or `routes explain`
- add integration coverage for CLI command flows, not just module-level behavior
- add better connector-send error classification and relay metrics

### Later-stage

- move persistent state from JSON file to SQLite or another small embedded store
- add richer audit history and delivery history instead of current latest-state persistence only
- expose a tiny status dashboard for active tasks, connector health, and bridge warnings
- add upstream idempotency support if the downstream AgentSwarm API exposes a stable mechanism

## Suggested Operating Routine

Use this sequence when working on AgentSwarm:

1. update `agentsswarm/.env`
2. run `npm run cli -- preflight`
3. start the bridge
4. run `npm run cli -- doctor`
5. test ingest with `npm run cli -- ingest ...`
6. prune stale state if needed with `npm run cli -- prune --dry-run`

## Changelog Summary for This Pass

- documented the full current runtime context in this file
- hardened ingress and bridge authentication defaults
- improved persistence safety and stale-state cleanup
- improved provider selection behavior when tools are unavailable
- improved observability and operator diagnostics
- expanded test coverage to lock in the new behavior
