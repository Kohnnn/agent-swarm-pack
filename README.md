## What is GoClaw?

[GoClaw](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/goclaw) is OpenClaw rebuilt in Go — a production-grade multi-agent AI gateway with:

- **Single binary** (~25 MB, no Node.js runtime, <1s startup, runs on a $5 VPS)
- **Multi-tenant PostgreSQL** — per-user workspaces, encrypted API keys (AES-256-GCM), isolated sessions
- **Agent Teams** — lead + member orchestration with shared task boards, sync/async delegation, and mailbox messaging
- **20+ LLM providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Gemini, Mistral, xAI, Ollama, Claude CLI, Codex, and more
- **7 messaging channels** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu/Lark, Zalo OA, Zalo Personal, WhatsApp
- **5-layer security** — gateway auth → global tool policy → per-agent → per-channel → owner-only, plus rate limiting and prompt injection detection
- **Skills system** — `SKILL.md` packages with BM25 + pgvector hybrid search
- **Built-in observability** — LLM call tracing with spans, prompt cache metrics, optional OpenTelemetry export
- **Heartbeat + Cron** — proactive periodic check-ins and scheduled agent tasks
- **Knowledge graph** — LLM-powered entity extraction and relationship traversal

## Quick Start

### 1. Install GoClaw

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextlevelbuilder/goclaw/main/scripts/install-lite.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextlevelbuilder/goclaw/main/scripts/install-lite.ps1 | iex
```

**Or from source (Go 1.26+):**
```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/goclaw.git && cd goclaw
make build
./goclaw onboard
source .env.local && ./goclaw
```

### 2. Configure at least one LLM provider

Edit `.env.local` in the goclaw directory:
```env
GOCLAW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOCLAW_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Or use OpenRouter for access to 100+ models:
```env
GOCLAW_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

### 3. Connect a channel

**Telegram:**
```bash
./goclaw channels add telegram
# Follow interactive prompts for bot token
```

**Discord:**
```bash
./goclaw channels add discord
# Follow interactive prompts for bot token and gateway intents
```

### 4. Create your first agent

```bash
./goclaw agents add --name "assistant" --provider anthropic
```

### 5. Start the gateway

```bash
./goclaw
# Web dashboard: http://localhost:18790
```

## GoClaw Agent Teams

GoClaw's team system maps directly to the agent pack concept:

```
Lead Agent (orchestrator)
  ├── Member 1 (specialist)
  ├── Member 2 (specialist)
  ├── Member 3 (specialist)
  ├── Member 4 (specialist)
  └── Member 5 (specialist)
```

Each agent runs with its own identity, tools, LLM provider, and context files. The lead orchestrates via:

- **Task Board** (`team_tasks`) — create, claim, complete tasks with `blocked_by` dependencies
- **Delegation** — sync (wait for result) or async (wait for announcement) task assignment
- **Mailbox** — team members communicate via direct messages

### Creating a Team

```bash
./goclaw teams create --name "research-desk" --lead research_lead
./goclaw teams add research-desk --agents crawler fact_check data_analyst writer editor
```

Or via the dashboard at `http://localhost:18790`.

### Delegation Pattern

```
User → Lead Agent (research_lead)
         ├── Sync delegate → fact_check_lead (quick verification)
         └── Async delegate → crawler_specialist (deep research)
                   ↓ (later)
              crawler_specialist announces result to lead
         ↓
    Lead synthesizes and delivers to user
```

## Agent Pack Templates

Pre-built, deployment-ready agent swarms for GoClaw. Each pack is a complete team with role-specific context files, coordination patterns, and Discord/Telegram channel wiring.

### Available Packs

| Pack | Team | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| `dev-ops-corp` | 9 agents | Coding & release workflows |
| `research_report` | 6 agents | Research → fact-check → polished report |
| `review_desk` | 6 agents | Multi-specialist review with PASS/FAIL verdicts |
| `financial_analyst` | 6 agents | Market analysis → risk assessment → briefing |
| `second_brain` | 7 agents | Personal knowledge capture & retrieval |

See [templates/samples/](templates/samples/) for full pack library, agent rosters, and GoClaw deployment commands.

## Porting Packs to GoClaw

The 4-file per-agent structure maps directly to GoClaw's context file system:

| Original Pack File | GoClaw Context File | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | `SOUL.md` | Persona, core truths, tone, boundaries |
| `IDENTITY.md` | `IDENTITY.md` | Name, emoji, avatar, communication style |
| `AGENTS.md` | *(integrated into SOUL.md + system prompt)* | Workspace conventions, memory, group chat rules, heartbeat |
| `TOOLS.md` | `TOOLS.md` | Role-specific tool notes, environment details |
| `USER.md` | `USER.md` | Human profile, project context, preferences |

### Key Differences

1. **No file-based workspaces** — GoClaw stores agents, context files, and memory in PostgreSQL. Files are loaded into context at runtime.

2. **Teams replace orchestration scripts** — Instead of Discord channel routing and manual agent coordination, use GoClaw's native team system with `team_tasks` and delegation.

3. **Skills are first-class** — Pack-specific skills (e.g., `SKILL.md` for research methodology, financial analysis, code review) go in `goclaw/skills/` and are injectable per-agent.

4. **TEAM.md is auto-generated** — GoClaw injects `TEAM.md` at runtime for team members. Don't create it manually.

5. **Context file injection** — Use `./goclaw agents update <name> --context-files` or the dashboard to inject pack context files into agents.

### Porting Steps

```
1. Map agents to GoClaw team members
   agents add --name research_lead --provider anthropic
   agents add --name crawler_specialist --provider openai
   ...

2. Create a team and link agents
   teams create --name research-report --lead research_lead
   teams add research-report --agents crawler_specialist fact_check_lead data_analyst technical_writer summary_editor

3. Inject context files per agent
   agents update research_lead --context-files templates/samples/research_report/research_lead/

4. Add pack-specific skills
   cp -r templates/samples/research_report/skills/ goclaw/skills/

5. Configure channel bindings
   agents bind --agent research_lead --channel telegram --chat-id YOUR_CHAT_ID
```

See [GOCLAW_PACKS.md](GOCLAW_PACKS.md) for the full porting guide.
